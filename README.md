# Overview
In this project, we will be creating a speed typing game that will track how many words the player types correctly and display the player's wpm speed.
The player will be able to choose an animal as their icon and as they play the typing game, based on how many words the player types correctly, the difficulty will increase as well as the speed of the animal. The goal of the game will be to get the animal to the end as quickly as possible while aiming for a high wpm.
